Dat files are structured with the following:
  Column 1 = block number (BN)
  Column 2 = trial number (TN)
  Column 3 = subject number (subNum)
  Column 4 = day
  Column 5 = hand; 1 = left hand, 2 = right hand
  Column 6 = chord ID
    1 = finger extension
    2 = finger flexion
    9 = no cue
  Column 7 = planning time; set to 0
  Column 8 = maximum execution time; maximum time to complete trial, set to 10s
  Column 9 = feedback time; time between trials

Mov files show force readings at every 2ms (500 Hz) for a block.
